# Real Data

LatentBrain targets MC_Maze-style Neural Latents Benchmark data as the first real neural dataset family because it exercises trial-aligned population spiking tensors, held-in and held-out neuron contracts, and reproducible split handling without requiring model training.

## Current capability

Real-data support is a local ingestion scaffold. It validates configuration, checks for local NLB-style files, attempts to adapt local files into the existing `NeuralDataset` schema, records provenance, and saves processed arrays only when real local data can be loaded.

No model has been trained. No benchmark result exists. No EvalAI or public leaderboard submission is claimed or planned here; the public NLB challenge has ended, so future evaluation should be local and reproducible.

## Synthetic validation versus real-data validation

Synthetic data validates shape contracts, split leakage checks, masks, hashing, and save/load behavior with deterministic arrays.

Real-data validation applies the same core contracts to externally obtained recordings. It additionally preserves provenance, dataset variant details, file manifests, local configuration snapshots, and session identifiers when available.

## Manual dataset policy

LatentBrain does not download MC_Maze automatically. Obtain data only from public resources or institutions that grant you access under their published terms. Store the files locally and keep them out of Git.

Recommended first target:

```text
MC_Maze Small DANDI: https://gui.dandiarchive.org/#/dandiset/000140
Official NLB datasets page: https://neurallatents.github.io/datasets
```

Local path for the first run:

```text
data/raw/nlb/mc_maze_small
```

You may override the local root with:

```text
LATENTBRAIN_NLB_ROOT=
```

Expected candidate files include `.nwb`, `.h5`, `.hdf5`, `.mat`, or `.npz`. The current loader only attempts `.nwb`, `.h5`, and `.hdf5` through `nlb_tools`; other candidate files are reported but not treated as successful loads.

## Optional dependencies

The base development install does not require neural-data tooling:

```powershell
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

For local NLB preparation, use:

```powershell
python -m pip install -e ".[dev,neurodata]"
```

If `nlb-tools` is not available from pip in your environment, install it manually from the official Neural Latents Benchmark GitHub repository:

```powershell
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/neurallatents/nlb_tools.git
```

## Local preparation

1. Open the official Neural Latents Benchmark datasets page.
2. Go to MC_Maze.
3. Choose the Small DANDI repository first.
4. Download the dataset legally and ethically using DANDI or the DANDI web interface.
5. Place files under `data/raw/nlb/mc_maze_small`.
6. Inspect local files.
7. Prepare validated local arrays.

```powershell
python scripts/inspect_nlb_files.py --root data/raw/nlb/mc_maze_small
python scripts/prepare_nlb_data.py --config configs/nlb_mc_maze_small.yaml
```

If local data is missing, both commands exit nonzero with guidance and create no fake outputs. If local data is present and readable, processed outputs are written under ignored `data/processed/nlb/mc_maze_small` paths.

## Storage and version control

Do not commit real dataset files, processed arrays, metadata generated from real data, credentials, checkpoints, generated metrics, or experiment outputs. The repository tracks code, configs, tests, and documentation only.

## Future local evaluation

The first real-data run is validation only. Future work may add local reproducible evaluation against validated splits. Such evaluation must record the Git commit, config snapshot, dataset provenance, split seed, artifact hashes, and all relevant environment details before any result is reported.
